- Some Qt applications do not appear in the unity-panel-service systray (eg. ktorrent, quassel)
    However some QT applications (eg. skype, qbittorrent, vlc) are not affected for some reason
	sni-qt is a package that turns QT systray icons into appindicators on-the-fly,
	but requires a patched dev-qt/qtgui to work
    The same applications that do not appear in the unity-panel-service systray, also do not work with
	sni-qt in Ubuntu
