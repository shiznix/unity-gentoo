* To rebuild all packages against new GTK libs using qdepends (part of app-portage/portage-utils):
emerge -1 `qdepends -CNQ x11-libs/gtk+ 2> /dev/null`

* Using portage tree libindicate packages
	- unity-indicators/indicator-appmenu requires
		dev-libs/libdbusmenu, dev-libs/libindicator and dev-libs/libappindicator all be built with x11-libs/gtk:2 support
	- Many indicators (bluetooth, weather, etc.) require dev-libs/libappindicator be built with Python GTK+-2.x bindings to function
	- Gentoo is in the position of dropping GTK+-2.x Ubuntu Ayatana libraries from tree so we must maintain our own versions of
		dev-libs/libdbusmenu
		dev-libs/libindicator
		dev-libs/libappindicator

* Core python deps. for the Dash lens to work
	dev-libs/dee
	dev-libs/libappindicator
	dev-libs/libunity
	unity-lenses/unity-lens-video

x11-libs/gtk+				# Needed for global appmenu

* Reasons for maintaining ebuild hooks:
app-accessibility/at-spi2-core		# Start 'accessibility bus' by default (https://wiki.debian.org/accessibility-devel)
app-admin/system-config-printer		# Fix Unity Control Center icon and About dialog icon
dev-lang/mono-4.4			# Fix as it's not able to build with current stable dev-libs/glibc versions

www-client/chromium			# Required to support Unity Launcher icon effects (no duplicate icons, quicklist menu, progress bar, window title bar fixes etc.)
www-client/firefox			# Add Unity menubar and desktop launcher with quicklist and translations

* Optional ebuild hooks managed via unity-extra/ehooks USE-flags:
app-office/libreoffice			# Add Human icon theme and make it the default
					# Add custom icons (savemodified_{large,small}.png)
					# https://github.com/LibreOffice/core/tree/3498ed37527b7af795f00dc6a55c11e65a313186/icon-themes/human

app-text/evince				# Add traditional menu bar (https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=736419), add menu translations
gnome-extra/nemo			# Remove 'Open as Root' context menu action
media-gfx/eog				# Add traditional menu bar (https://bugzilla.gnome.org/749976, https://bugs.debian.org/793445), add menu translations
media-gfx/gnome-screenshot		# Use Ubuntu help instead of GNOME help, don't use GtkHeaderBar, show the save dialog by default, don't try and use the GNOME Shell D-Bus interface, add quicklist area-shot option
media-sound/audacity			# Fix Exec command to use Unity menubar properly
media-video/totem			# Add traditional menubar (https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=749695)
net-im/pidgin				# Add chat section into messaging menu (Available, Away, Busy, Invisible, Offline)
x11-libs/vte:2.91			# Add the style context provider with FALLBACK priority
					# NOTE: see x11-terms/gnome-terminal

x11-misc/zim				# Install Ubuntu theme (/usr/share/icons/ubuntu-mono-{dark,light})
x11-terms/gnome-terminal		# Add style classes and CSS names to some of our widgets, use theme transparency, draw proper background under the scrollbar (https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=754796, LP #1493964)

* By design, some indicators or their features will not appear until they meet certain criteria
	- indicator-messages	# Won't appear until a messaging type application is run first (eg. empathy, evolution (via indicator-evolution), pidgin, webapp)
	- indicator-keyboard	# Won't appear until at least one input source is specified and 'Show current input source in menu bar' is checked in System Settings > Text Entry
	- indicator-session	# Won't show username until 'Show my login in menu bar' is checked in System Settings > User Accounts
					and then only if user has been added to /etc/passwd using useradd's '--comment' GECOS field

* Unity user specific settings locations
	- Dconf registry accessible via gsettings or dconf-editor
	- ~/.{cache,config,local}/...
	- /var/lib/AccountsService/users/<user>

* Empathy and message indicator integration
	- To reset all empathy accounts and configurations:
		rm -rfv ~/.cache/telepathy
		rm -rfv ~/.local/share/telepathy
		rm -rfv ~/.config/libaccounts-glib
		rm -rfv ~/.config/Empathy
		rm -rfv ~/.cache/folks
		rm -rfv ~/.local/share/folks
	- To debug signond, edit /etc/signond.conf and change 'LoggingLevel=...'
	- To debug signon-ui:
		killall signon-ui
		export SSOUI_LOGGING_LEVEL=2
		signon-ui
	- To debug telepathy packages:
		G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all FOO_PERSIST=1 FOO_DEBUG=all /path/to/telepathy-foo 2>&1 | tee foo.log

* Webapps integration
	- Requires the following packages:
		- dev-libs/libunity-webapps			(Integrates browser plugins with the desktop via libunity)
		- unity-base/webapps				(Contains site specific webapps)
		- unity-base/webapps-base			(Contains site specific webapps)
		- x11-misc/webapps-greasemonkey			(Unity Websites Integration browser plugin)
		- x11-misc/webaccounts-browser-extension	(Ubuntu Online Accounts browser plugin)
		- x11-misc/unity-firefox-extension		(Unity Desktop Integration browser plugin)
		- x11-misc/unity-chromium-extension		(Unity Desktop Integration browser plugin)

	- Problems:
		- 'unity-webapps-runner' (unity-base/unity-webapps) is used by the *.desktop files installed by
			Ubuntu packages but will only work if either chromium or firefox are set as the default browser
			Default browser setting is read from desktop user's ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list
	- Other stuff:
		- Webapps shown in the messages indicator are provided by the desktop user's ~/.local/share/applications/<provider>.desktop
		- Available webapps are stored in the desktop user's ~/.local/share/unity-webapps/availableapps-v2.db
		- Installed webapps are stored in the desktop user's ~/.local/share/unity-webapps/apps2.db
	- To reset all installed webapps back to zero (and so get re-prompted to integrate each site), and remove indicator integration:
		rm -rfv ~/.local/share/applications/<webapp_provider>.desktop
		gsettings set com.canonical.unity.webapps allowed-domains ['']
		Reset browser extension installed websites:
			- Chromium:	Settings > Advanced Settings > Installed Websites > Exceptions
			- Firefox:	Edit > Preferences > Desktop Integration > Exceptions
	- Possible TODO:
		- Package Ubuntu's version of app-misc/geoclue so that the Amazon webapp regional settings work when running 'unity-webapps-runner -a'

* Debugging Unity
	- Emerge unity-base/unity with the 'debug' USE flag enabled, and restart xsession
	- Check ~/.xsession-errors and syslog
	- gsettings get org.compiz.core:/org/compiz/profiles/unity/plugins/core/ active-plugins

* Debugging top panel systray/indicator icons and menus
	- In desktop user's xterm, issue the following command:
		killall indicator-application-service; G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all /usr/libexec/indicator-application/indicator-application-service
	- Get list of currently running indicators with the following command:
		dbus-send --type=method_call --print-reply --dest=com.canonical.indicator.application \
			/com/canonical/indicator/application/service com.canonical.indicator.application.service.GetApplications

* Ubuntu Single Signon
	- Check ~/.cache/sso/sso-client*.log

## Systemd Session Launch ##
* Unity session is launched as follows:
	- Display manager (eg.lightdm) executes /usr/share/xsessions/unity.desktop:
		- '/usr/share/xsessions/unity.desktop' executes '/usr/libexec/run-systemd-session unity-session.target'
			OR
	- Started from console with 'XSESSION=unity startx':
		- '/etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/99unity-session_systemd' executes '/usr/libexec/run-systemd-session unity-session.target'

		- '/usr/libexec/run-systemd-session unity-session.target' runs 'systemctl --user start --wait unity-session.target'
		- '/usr/lib/systemd/user/unity-session.target' starts:
			- 'gnome-session.service' which in turn executes 'gnome-session --session=unity'
			- 'unity7.service' is auto-started due to existence of '/usr/lib/systemd/user/unity-session.target.requires/unity7.service' symlink
		- All other Unity systemd service units are then started as being 'PartOf=graphical-session.target'
		- Most importantly, unity7.service unit does the following:
			- Executes '/usr/lib/unity/systemd-prestart-check' to check if we're in an upstart or systemd session
			- Sets the compizconfig profile to 'COMPIZ_CONFIG_PROFILE=ubuntu' via '/usr/lib/unity/compiz-profile-selector'
			- Performs 'ExecStart=/usr/bin/compiz'
			- Pulls in and starts {unity-settings-daemon,unity-panel-service,bamfdaemon}.service units

## Compiz performance settings for 'ccsm' ##
 Click on "OpenGL" and set "Texture Filter" to Fast.
 Make sure "Sync to V blank" is selected, that Texture Compression is NOT selected, and make sure Frame Buffer, Vertex Buffer, and Always Use Buffer Swapping ARE all selected.
 Scroll down to "Image Loading" and make sure all options (jpeg, png, svg, and text) ARE selected.
 * Some applications such as Steam or Chromium with hardware acceleration enabled may lose window focus particularly after unminising the window or waking from screen lock/blank
	- Enabling the 'Keep previews' option under 'Compiz Workarounds' fixes this issue
